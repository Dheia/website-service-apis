                The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the most powerful encryption available
                on the Internet. Any information related to your credit card is encrypted
                when being transmitted. You will see that you are entering a secure area
                when the URL to the left of the colon changes from http to https. Also,
                your browser may have a special symbol, like a key or a lock. Having a
                secure server takes the risk out of your credit card transactions. If at
                any time you do not feel comfortable providing your credit card information
                while shopping online, please contact your Signet® customer care team via
