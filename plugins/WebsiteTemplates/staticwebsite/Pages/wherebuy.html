        <p id="u4754-6">Golf Trends Inc. has been supplying golf equipment to almost all golf
            course pro shops and golf retail/specialty shops for over 25 years. If
            you are interested in any of the brands/products we distribute, please
            contact your local</p>

        <h2 id="u4754-11">I contacted my local proshop/golf retailer, but they do not have what I'm looking for?</h2>
        <p id="u4754-14"><span id="u4754-13">Our product offering is quite large, and it is almost impossible for a proshop/golf retailer to carry every product we offer.</span>
        </p>
        <p id="u4754-16"><span id="u4754-15">However, every proshop/retailer can place a special order for any product we have in stock.  Also, our warehouse staff are second to none - shipping most orders same day if they are received before 12pm EST.</span>
