                                        on any order delivered within the State, unless our (distributor) customer
                                        has a valid CA Resale Certificate. Distributors who are not CA residents
                                        are subject to the same law and must obtain a valid CA Resale Certificate,
                                        or charge and collect the applicable CA sales taxes, for those orders we
                                        drop ship within CA on their behalf. See CA Sales and Use Tax Regulations,
                                        Article 18, Regulation 1706. Additionally, because we do not know the retail
                                        sales price to the end user, CA law further requires that we add 10% to
                                        the wholesale cost on our invoice, and then charge the applicable CA sales
                                        tax on that amount.** All sales taxes we collect from you are remitted
                                        to the State of California sales tax authorities.</p>

                                        1) Which State collects the Sales Tax – an end user must always pay a sales
                                        tax, but they are only required to pay to the State where the goods were
                                        delivered. They do not have to pay Sales Taxes in their own State, or in
                                        the Distributor’s State, if the goods were not delivered to either of those
                                        States, and 2) Does a distributor need a CA Resale Certificate – the answer
                                        is no, but they will have to charge and collect sales tax on all drop shipments
                                        within the State and pay the tax to the supplier who drop shipped the goods
                                        in CA on their behalf. The CA supplier remits the sales tax to the State
                                        of CA sales tax authorities.</p>
