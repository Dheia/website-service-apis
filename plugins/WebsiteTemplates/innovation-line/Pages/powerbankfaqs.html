                        <p id="int5h6a">Q: What is mAh?</p>
                        <p align="justify" class="innoline">A: mAh or “Milliamp Hours” is a unit for measuring the amount of stored
                            energy or capacity of a battery. The mAh rating on promotional Power Banks
                            explains how much energy they can transferto a recharging device like a
                            cell phone.The higher the mAh of a Power Bank battery, the longer amount
                            of time and/or energy it can provide to recharge an electronic device like
                            a cell phone.</p>
                        <p id="imq3ia5">Q: What are Volts and Amps?</p>
                        <p align="justify" class="innoline">A: Volts are the electrical pressure or strength of the current while
                            Amps are the amount of electrical volumethat moves through. Most promotional
                            power banks, chargers and cables are rated for 5 Volts which is sufficient
                            for their operation. Amps are more important because they effect the speed
                            of charging. If you think of a water pipe – the size of the pipe is analogous
                            to Amps. A smaller diameter pipe (lower Amps) will not push through as
                            much water (electrical current) as fast as a wider diameter pipe (higher
                            Amps). Typically the lower the number of outputted amps, the longer it
                            will take for a product to be re-charged.</p>
                        <p id="ikox3g5">Q: What is Output and Input Current?</p>
                        <p align="justify" class="innoline">A: Output is characterized in Amps (explained above) and indicates the
                            volume of power a charger is capable of delivering out to a device and
                            how quickly. Input is characterized in Volts (also explained above)and
                            relates to the power source coming into a promotional charger or power
                            bank. Most promotional chargers operate on 5 Volts to work properly.</p>
                        <p
                        id="iynfdwi">Q: What is Standby Time?</p>
                            <p align="justify" class="innoline">A: Standby Time is the amount of time a power bank will hold its charge
                                when not in use.A 2200 mAh power bank will typically have xxx of Standby
                                Time.</p>
                            <p id="i7cndb5">Q: What do I need to know about mAh, Volts and Amps as they relate to
                                the electronic products typically sold in the promotional products market?</p>
                            <p
                            align="justify" class="innoline">A1: In relation to promotional power banks, mAhexplainshow much power
                                a power bank cantransfer to a re-charging electronic device (like a cell
                                phone), and Amps explain how fast the re-charging can occur. Higher mAh
                                power banksprovide a higher charge so you can re-charge a larger battery
                                device,or provide more charging power to smaller battery devices. For example,
                                the iPhone 6 has an 1800 mAh battery and the iPhone 6+ has a 2915 mAh battery
                                so a promotional power bank with 2200 mAh could fully charge an iphone
                                6 and partially charge an iphone 6+. Promotional power banks are typically
                                rated 1 Amp. A cell phone is also typically rated 1 Amp, while tablets
                                are often rated 2.1 Amps. Therefore, a 1 Amp promotional power bank will
                                charge a cell phone at normal speed yetcharge a tablet at a slower speed.</p>

                                align="justify" class="innoline">A2: In relation to promotional car and home plug in chargersand recharging
                                    cables, Volts and Amps are important (not mAh because batteries are not
                                    involved) because those measurements tell you what devices can be charged
                                    efficiently when using them. For example, most plug in (wall or car) chargers
                                    have an input of 5 Volts which is sufficient for charging cell phones and
                                    tablets. And, promotional chargers are typically rated 1 Amp so they efficiently
                                    charge cell phones, which are also rated 1 Amp), but slower when charging
                                    tablets, which are typically rated 2.1 Amps. Check the rating on your charging
                                    cables, if they can handle 2.1 Amps you can use them for efficiently charging
                                    cell phones and tablets.</p>
